# Positioning Analytics

📊 A web app for exploring market positioning data (Commitment of Traders, speculative positioning, etc.) combined with technical analysis overlays.  
The goal is to highlight when markets are extended or crowded, and generate insights like:

- “Gold is at 90% of historic speculator longs and 8× ATR% away from its 50-day MA”
- “Large specs are the most net long they've ever been in combined Gold + Bitcoin”
- “Previous 3 times this setup occurred, the market declined at least 10%”

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (UI & charts)
- **Backend**: Python (data processing, analytics, ML experiments)
- **Hosting (planned)**: AWS

## 📌 Roadmap
- [x] Setup React + TypeScript project
- [x] Display mock charts (sample positioning data)
- [x] Add custom chart combinations (e.g. Gold + Silver)
- [ ] Integrate technical analysis overlays (moving averages, ATR, etc.)
- [x] Build backend to fetch & process COT data
- [ ] Add ML/AI module to surface interesting trade setups

## 💡 Why?
I’m building this project both to deepen my skills in **React, TypeScript, Python, and AWS**, and to create something genuinely useful for traders & market nerds like me.
